# Project_PROMAP
Project PROMAP (acronym for Probabilistic Prediction of Material Properties) is a fesibility study which seeks to merge Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with Bayesian statistics to yield probabilistic estimates of target features under scarse data/information. The context of this study is with regards to the following Nuclear material properties: 1) Creep rupture; and 2) Tensile. This repository contains the MATLAB codes required to perform such analysis.
